# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
## Description of Project
The project focuses on helping an upcoming playwright, Louise, start a crowdfunding campaign to fund her theater play, Fever.  Microsoft Excel is used to analyse similar kickstarter campaigns to give Louise an understanding of factors that can make her campaign successful. 
## Purpose of Project
Louise's play, Fever has an estimated budget of over $10,000. She needs to know if she can meet her fundraising goal in the US market for her theater play.
She also needs a recommendation on a favorable launch date for the play.
## Analysis of Category Outcomes
Since Louise is interested in launching Fever in US, we analyzed kickstarter campaigns in the US market. Of the 912 campaigns launched, theater has 525 successful fundraisers, that is over 50% success rate.

## Analysis of Theater Fundraisers in US market
We analyzed the outcomes of theater subcategories in the US market since Fever is a theatrical play. Of all the subcategories in theater, we found that plays have better ratio of success to failure fundraisers.

## Fundraiser Findings based on Launch Date
To help Louise plan her campaign timeline, we also looked at how campaign length might be tied to its outcome. The chart suggests that the months of May and June both have a greater success rate. January, June, July and October all had roughly the same number of failed campaigns launched.

## Statistical Analysis of US fundraiser campaigns
Next, we considered Kickstarter campaigns for plays in the U.S. and compared the statistics for the campaigns that succeeded versus those that failed.
The results showed that **failed Kickstarter campaigns have much higher fundraising goals than successful Kickstarter campaigns** . 

## Recommendations for Fever
As per our analysis, we found that the average goal for a successful kickstarter is around $5000. Louise is asking for more than twice the average successful Kickstarter goal.  ***She should reduce the goal to around $5000 for her campaign to be successful. The months of May and June look favorable for Fever's launch***.  

## Analysis of Musical Outcomes in the Great British Market
Louise is also interested in researching musicals in Great Britain for a future project with an estimated budget of £4,000. To present her with the big picture, we created box plots using statistical computations.

## Recommendations for Musical Fundraisers
The mean campaign goal for theater musicals is around £4,000. This is outside of the range of outliers for amount pledged, so ***Louise should probably try to get her musical produced for less than £4,000 in Great Britain***.
