# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
## Description of Project
The project focuses on helping an upcoming playwright, Louise, start a crowdfunding campaign to fund her theater play, Fever. Fever has an estimated budget of over $10,000. Microsoft Excel is used to analyse similar kickstarter campaigns to give Louise an understanding of factors that can make her campaign successful.
## Analysis of Outcomes
Since Louise is interested in launching Fever in US, we analyzed kickstarter campaigns in the US market. Of all the categories, we found that theater is more successful. The data also shows a count of 525 successful theater outcomes, a good number to boost Louise's confidence!

Next, we analyzed the outcomes of theater subcategories in the US market since Fever is a theatrical play. Of all the subcategories in theater, we found that plays have the most successful outcomes.

To help Louise plan her campaign timeline, we also looked at how campaign length might be tied to its outcome. The chart suggests that the months of May and June both have a greater success rate. January, June, July and October all had roughly the same number of failed campaigns launched.

Next, we considered Kickstarter campaigns for plays in the U.S. and compared the statistics for the campaigns that succeeded versus those that failed.
The results showed that failed Kickstarter campaigns have much higher fundraising goals than successful Kickstarter campaigns. 
In addition, the mean and median pledged amounts are much lower than the successful pledges, which indicates that failed Kickstarter campaigns are unsuccessful for reasons other than asking for too much money. 

So, we took our analysis a step further and measured the spread of the dataset. We found that the mean of successful goals is distributed around the 3rd quartile. Similar distributions are observed in datasets of failed goals, successful pledges and failed pledges.
The standard deviations are all roughly twice the IQR in each distribution, except in the failed Kickstarters, where the standard deviation is closer to three times the IQR. There must be some failed Kickstarters with really high goals! We concluded that Fever's estimated budget will not pose as an outlier.  

## Recommendations

As per our analysis, we found that the average goal for a successful kickstarter is around $5000. Louise is asking for more than twice the average successful Kickstarter goal, so this isn't great news for her campaign. She should try reducing the goal to around $5000 for her campaign to be successful. Fever would have a greater success rate when launched in the months of May and June.  

## Analysis of Musical Outcomes in the Great British Market
Louise is also interested in researching musicals in Great Britain for a future project with an estimated budget of £4,000. To present her with the big picture, we created box plots using statistical computations.

The mean campaign goal for theater musicals is around £4,000. This is outside of the range of outliers for amount pledged, so Louise should probably try to get her musical produced for less than £4,000 in Great Britain.
