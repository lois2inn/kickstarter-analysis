# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
This project focuses on helping Louise understand how her fundraising campaign for theater play, Fever fared compared to other campaigns. Microsoft Excel is used to analyze and visualize campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals. 

### Purpose
Louise wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The month of May had the most successful launches across campaigns from different categories. The line chart below shows theater outcomes based on launch date as Fever was a theater play. 
![Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png](/resources/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png)
- The month of May had the most successful theater fundraisers followed by June and July. 
- May, June, July and October all had roughly the same number of failed campaigns.
- December had the same number of successful and failed campaigns.
- The number of canceled campaigns were significantly less compared to successful and failed campaigns.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
All the fundraisers under "plays" subcategory were analyzed for their outcomes based on funding goals.
![Outcomes_vs_Goals.png](/resources/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png)
- Campaigns with funding goals of $1000 or less were 75% successful. 
- Campaigns with funding goals between $1000 and $5000 were 73% successful.
- Campaigns with funding over $45000 failed significantly.
- The canceled campaigns were less than 1%, which is insignificant compared to other outcomes.  


### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Reading the graphs and charts to record the data findings and conclusions is a challenge. Alloting considerable time to make conclusions has helped.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?  
**Since the months of May and June had the most successful outcomes, Louise could plan on launching her future theater fundraisers around this time.
May and June also had roughly same number of failed outcomes.**

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?  
**Campaigns with funding goals at $5000 or less had greater success.**

- What are some limitations of this dataset?  
**Limited sample size, missing data across categories and subcategories except for theater.**  

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?  
**Outcomes across countries could be analyzed to see which country encourages theater.**
